# Motivation

- I chose for Nux3 as per advice from a colleague to show your skills in the lastest tech
- I chose for a mild TypeScript support (not strict) for code completion and therefore time saving (less bug tracing)
- I used some 'any' types to save time with creating interfaces
- I used some resources I had haning around from own projects (styling mixins for instance)
- I chose my own implementation of state management because this is possible in Vue3 and because of time saving (less scaffolding)
- I excluded url manipulation because of the time frame
- I exluded svg's/icons because of the time frame
- I excluded header/footer becuase of the timeframe
