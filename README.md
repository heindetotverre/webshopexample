# Motivation

- I chose Nuxt3 as per advice from a colleague to show my skills in the lastest tech
- I chose for a mild TypeScript support (not strict) for code completion and therefore time saving to focus on important aspects of the prototype
- I used some 'any' types to focus on important aspects of the prototype
- I used some resources I had hanging around from private projects (styling mixins for instance)
- I chose my own implementation of state management because this is possible, because of time saving (less scaffolding) and less packages in project
- I excluded url manipulation based on filters to limit scope of the project
- I exluded svg's/icons to focus on important aspects of the prototype
- I excluded header/footer to focus on important aspects of the prototype
- The elements that look unfinished are unfinished
