# Instructions

volar vscode extension for best dev expierence

npm install

npm run dev

# Motivation

- I chose Nuxt3 as per advice from a colleague to show my skills in the lastest tech
- I chose for a mild TypeScript support (not strict) for code completion and therefore time saving to focus on important aspects of the prototype
- I used some 'any' types to focus on important aspects of the prototype
- I used some resources I had hanging around from private projects (styling mixins for instance)
- I chose my own implementation of state management because this is possible in Vue3 and because of time saving (less scaffolding)
- I excluded url manipulation based on filters to focus on important aspects of the prototype
- I exluded svg's/icons to focus on important aspects of the prototype
- I excluded header/footer to focus on important aspects of the prototype

# PS

Vue 3 as the standard as of 07-02. Happy days :)
